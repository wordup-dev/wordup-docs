After a successful build your WordPress plugin or theme will be published as a new release and it is ready for distribution. 

## Private or public

If your Wordup project is saved as a **public** project, all your releases will be publicly available for everybody on the internet.

Usually **we recommend** to make your project *private*. If you have a private project all your project data and releases of your project will be secure and can be only accessed with a secure token.

## Product key

On each project you can create so called *product keys*. With these product keys you can give your clients or WordPress installations access to your releases.

Note: A Product key gives **only** access to releases, no other data of your project is accessible with these keys.
