Every WordPress developer has their own tools of choice for developing and testing new plugins and themes.

Wordup can be used with any of these tools in combination with the Wordup CLI and our dashboard.

* The Wordup CLI will provide you with all the commands you need to test and publish your WordPress plugins and themes.
* With the dashboard (under https://console.wordup.dev) you can manage your plugins/themes in the cloud.
