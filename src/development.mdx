# Development


## Setup a new project

After you have installed wordup-cli, you are able to initialize a new project. Simply run in a directory of your choice.

```sh-session
$ wordup init
```

You will be guided to some setup options. After installing your new project, the WordPress development servers will be started automatically.

### Scaffold your project source code

Wordup is able to create boilerplate source code for your project. Currently supported boilerplate projects are:

* For themes: [underscore](https://github.com/automattic/_s), [understrap](https://github.com/understrap/understrap) 
* For plugins: Official WordPress boilerplate code

### Src folder

Your WordPress plugin or theme source code is located inside the ./src folder. 
In general you should place all project specific files (like CI config etc.) outside your ./src folder and all files you want to distribute inside.

### Project slug 

Each WordPress theme or plugin is defined with a slug. This is a string to identify your plugin or theme inside WordPress.
Wordup will create automatically a slug based on your project name. 
In the wordup design philosophy the slug is just a config value. That's why you can change it in the config.yml later.

## Developing 

After you have setup your project and your docker containers have been initialized, 
you are ready to develop your plugin/theme.

Now you can make use of all wordup benefits:

* You can develop projects in parallel with multipe installations on different ports.
* Test your source code against your fixtures. Even with CI tools in the cloud.
* Export and distribute your source code

## Start/Stop

With `wordup start` and `wordup stop` you can start and stop your development servers. 
This is useful when you just want to pause your development. All changes in your WordPress installation will be kept.

### Delete 

Use `wordup stop --delete` to delete the WordPress server completly. *Caution:* All your data in your WordPress installation will be deleted.

## Snippets

You can extend your source code with custom snippets for Gutenberg blocks, taxonomies or custom post-types.
Just include the generated php file in your main project file.

For example:

```sh-session
$ wordup snippet block MyGutenbergBlock
```

## Export

After some development you probably want to distribute your source code. You are able to:

* Export the project source code into zip-file, ready for distribution.
* Export the WordPress database.
* Export the whole WordPress installation. Your project files and all data are included.

### Install from exported files

When you export the whole installation, you will be able to install a wordup project based on your exported installation:

```sh-session
$ wordup install --archive=./dist/installation.tar.gz
```
