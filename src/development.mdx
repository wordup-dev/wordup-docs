# Development


## Setup a new project

After you have installed wordup-cli, you are able to initialize a new project. Simply run in a directory of your choice:

```sh
$ wordup init
```

You will be guided to some setup options. After installing your new project, the WordPress development servers will be started automatically.

### Project types

Wordup supports three different project types. Choose your project type based on what you want to develop:

* Develop a plugin (*type:* plugins): If you want to develop a new plugin for WordPress
* Develop a theme (*type:* themes): If you want to develop a theme or child theme for WordPress
* Basic installation (*type:* installation): If you need a local WordPress server with access to wp-content files

The project type will be saved in the config.yml under *type*.


### Scaffold your project source code

Wordup is able to create boilerplate source code for your project. Currently supported boilerplate projects are:

* For themes: [underscore](https://github.com/automattic/_s), [understrap](https://github.com/understrap/understrap) 
* For plugins: Official WordPress boilerplate code

### The *src* folder

Your WordPress plugin or theme source code is located by default inside the ./src folder. 
In general you should place all project specific files (like CI config etc.) outside your *src* folder and all files you want to distribute inside.

For *installation* projects the *src* folder represents the wp-content folder of the WordPress installation.
Wordup doesn't show the rest of the WordPress source-code because you should never change files outside of the wp-content folder.

**Hint:** You can change the *src* folder to a folder of your choice in the [config.yml](/config#configyml)

### Project slug 

Each WordPress theme or plugin is defined with a slug. This is a string to identify your plugin or theme in WordPress.
Wordup will create automatically a slug based on your project name. 
In the wordup design philosophy the slug is just a config value. That's why you can change it in the config.yml later.


## Folder structure

A default wordup project structure looks like this:

```
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
├── package.json
├── .wordup
|    ├── config.yml 
|    └── (Your fixture folders for posts, pages or media files)
├── dist
|    └── (Your exported plugin/theme files)
└── src
     ├── .distignore
     └── (Your plugin/theme src files)
```

## Developing 

After you have setup your project and your docker containers have been initialized, 
you are ready to develop your plugin/theme.

Now you can make use of all wordup benefits:

* Local development of multiple projects in parallel.
* Test your source code against your fixtures. Even with CI tools in the cloud.
* Export and distribute your source code. 
* Backup your WordPress installation.

## Start/Stop

With `wordup start` and `wordup stop` you can start and stop your development servers. 
This is useful when you just want to pause your development. Local docker containers will be stopped, but all data and changes in your WordPress installation will be kept.

### Delete 

Use `wordup stop --delete` to delete the WordPress server completly. *Caution:* All your data in your WordPress installation will be deleted.

## Snippets

You can extend your source code with custom snippets for Gutenberg blocks, taxonomies or custom post-types.
Just include the generated php file in your main project file.

For example:

```sh
$ wordup snippet block MyGutenbergBlock
```

## Export

After some development you probably want to distribute your source code. You are able to:

* Export the project source code into zip-file, ready for distribution.
* Export the WordPress database.
* Export the whole WordPress installation. Your project files and all data are included.

### Install from exported files

When you export the whole installation, you will be able to (re)install a wordup project based on your exported installation:

```sh
$ wordup install --archive=./dist/installation.tar.gz
```
