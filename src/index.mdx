# Getting Started

Wordup CLI is an open-source development toolkit for setting up and managing your local WordPress Theme/Plugin development, so that you can totally focus on coding.

It is based on docker-compose and uses a docker containerized LAMP-stack with all WordPress Plugins/Themes you need for your current project.

Useful links:
* [Official Homepage](https://wordup.dev)
* [wordup-cli on GitHub](https://github.com/wordup-dev/wordup-cli)
* [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wordup.wordup-code)

## Requirements

Make sure you have node >= 8.3 (npm >= 5.2) and [docker-compose](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed on your machine. 

If you dont want to signup for downloading Docker Desktop, you can download it directly here: 
* Windows: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/release-notes/
* Mac: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/release-notes/

## Installation

We recommend to install wordup-cli **globally** with npm: 

```sh-session
$ npm install -g wordup-cli
```
or with yarn: 

```sh-session
$ yarn global add wordup-cli
```

After installing wordup-cli, you can create your first project with `wordup init`

---

If you **don't want** to install wordup-cli globally, you can also use wordup-cli as a devDependency via `npx`. Start directly with a new wordup project: 

```sh-session
$ npx wordup-cli init
```

`npx wordup-cli init` will add automatically the wordup-cli to your new project devDependencies.

**Note:** If you use wordup-cli as a devDependency make sure to always use `npx` before every `wordup` command. 

## Your first project

Go to the [development](/development#setup-a-new-project) page and follow the instructions ðŸš€
