# Tools


## Visual Studio Code

If you use VSCode for your development, you can install our [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wordup.wordup-code). 
This extension will integrate all wordup features in your favorite editor.

### Build your custom VSCode task

You can extend VSCode easily with custom VSCode tasks for wordup. 
For example if you want to have a task to export the WordPress installation, 
than just add the following settings to your .vscode/tasks.json file in your project:

```json
{
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "label": "Export WordPress",
            "type": "shell",
            "command": "wordup export installation",
            "options": {
                "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

## Mailhog

In every project a [MailHog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog) container/service will start automatically along with your WordPress installation. 
This tool catches all outgoing emails from your WordPress installation.
The web frontend is available on localhost:[WORDPRESS_PORT + 1]
